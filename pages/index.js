            Egg prices are a useful indicator of consumer pressures because eggs
            are a staple in nearly every household, making their cost highly
            visible. Since eggs are affordable and widely bought, price changes
            reflect broader economic forces-such as supply chain issues and
            production costs-making them a practical gauge of inflationâ€™s impact
            on daily life.

              The Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated monthly by the U.S.
              Bureau of Labor Statistics, measures the average change over time
              in prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods
              and services, such as food, housing, transportation, and
              healthcare. As the most widely used indicator of inflation, the
              CPI tracks shifts in the cost of living, guiding policymakers,
              businesses, and consumers in adjusting wages, benefits, and
              economic decisions; when the CPI rises, it signals higher living
              costs and reduced purchasing power.
